HEALTH MATE
Health Mate is a web-based fitness tracking application designed to assist users in setting, monitoring, and achieving their health goals. In an era where maintaining a healthy lifestyle is increasingly difficult due to fast-paced routines, this system offers a structured platform that encourages discipline, motivation, and continuous self-improvement. The application enables users to input personalized fitness targets—such as daily steps, exercise frequency, and weight management—and provides real-time progress tracking. 

The project leverages modern web technologies to ensure an interactive and seamless user experience. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend is powered by Java Servlets and JDBC, with MySQL serving as the database. Key features include form validation, session management, local data persistence, and dynamic progress summaries. Users can view weekly insights into their fitness journey, which enhances engagement and self-awareness. 

By combining user-friendly interfaces with robust backend logic, Health Mate not only simplifies fitness tracking but also promotes healthier living through data-driven decisions. The project lays the groundwork for future enhancements such as AI-based health recommendations, graphical data visualizations, and mobile app integration.
